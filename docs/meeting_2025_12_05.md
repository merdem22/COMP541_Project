# Meeting Notes — 2025-12-05

- Agenda: nuScenes-mini data checks, baseline scope, fusion interface.
- Decisions:
  - Keep data pipeline modular (datasets + transforms) so models can swap without touching loaders.
  - Start with lidar-only baseline; plug camera BEV pooling later through the same fusion API.
  - Use mini split for iteration; revisit full nuScenes after sanity checks pass.
- Action items:
  - Run `scripts/data_sanity_check.py --batches 2` after any data-related changes.
  - Wire a toy training loop via `scripts/train_baseline.py` to validate shapes/gradients.
  - Stub graph module will live in `src/models/graph_module_placeholder.py` until design is finalized.
